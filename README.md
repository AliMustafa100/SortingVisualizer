# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project visualizes the selection sort algorithm using Pygame. It provides an interactive interface where you can start the sorting process and reset the bars to random heights.

## Features

- Visualization of the selection sort algorithm.
- Interactive interface with options to start sorting and reset the bars.
- Color-coded bars to indicate the current state (selected, smallest, sorted).

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed. 
2. Install the Pygame library using pip:
